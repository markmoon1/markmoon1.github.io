### CPSC 120

* Lab 7

    Lab 7, part 2 was enjoyable since I like card games so 
    making a program about one was a fun experience. In this program, 
    we practiced coding with functions. I was able to create individual 
    functions for different parts of the game which we called upon instead
    of creating the game's rules all inside one main function.

* Lab 8

    Lab 8, part 3 was a challenging program, but the finished product was
    pretty satisfying to watch. The output was an animation using ANSI & ASCII
    text to create the image. We accomplished this by learning how to access text 
    files with our code.

* Lab 12

    Lab 12, part 1 was where we learned how to make animation, but this time in GIF
    format. Similar to Lab 8, I liked this program because of the cool end product
    we were left with. In this lab, we used a combination of things that we learned
    in previous labs: vectors, magick++ library, and accessing files in the code.
